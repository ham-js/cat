# Overview

In order to send CAT commands to a device we need to implement a [command
factory](/docs/glossary#command-factory) and a [device
driver](/docs/glossary#driver) for it and interface a [communication driver](/docs/glossary#driver).

The following devices are supported:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Device Type</td>
      <td>Device Vendor</td>
      <td>Device Name</td>
      <td>Device Driver</td>
      <td>Command Factory</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {
      Devices.map(({deviceName, deviceType, deviceVendor}) => (
        <tr>
          <td>{DeviceTypes[deviceType]}</td>
          <td>{DeviceVendors[deviceVendor]}</td>
          <td>{deviceName}</td>
          <td>❌</td>
          <td>✅</td>
        </tr>
      ))
    }
  </tbody>
</table>
