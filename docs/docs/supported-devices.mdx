This is a live document. Look at the source code ("Edit this page" at
*the bottom) in order to understand how we receive this information.

:::warning
"Generic devices" are still based on a specific device. This means that your
device might not work with a generic device while we are figuring out common
ground between devices of the same vendor.

You can help us by [reporting bugs or missing features](https://github.com/ham-js/cat/issues/new) on GitHub!

The following devices are supported:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Device Type</td>
      <td>Device Vendor</td>
      <td>Device Name</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {
      Devices.map(({deviceName, deviceType, deviceVendor}) => (
        <tr>
          <td>{DeviceTypes[deviceType]}</td>
          <td>{deviceVendor}</td>
          <td>{deviceName}</td>
        </tr>
      ))
    }
  </tbody>
</table>
